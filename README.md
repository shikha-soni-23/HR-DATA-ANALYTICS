# HR-DATA-ANALYTICS

In this HR data analytics project, the focus is on analyzing a dataset related to absenteeism and health within a company.

Various tools and techniques are employed, including SQL queries, database development, and the creation of a Power BI dashboard.

## Tools Used
#### 1. SQL Queries:

#### 2. Database Development:

- Integrate data from Absenteeism_at_work, compensation, and Reasons tables for a comprehensive dataset.

#### 3. Power BI Dashboard:
