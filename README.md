# HR-DATA-ANALYTICS

In this HR data analytics project, the focus is on analyzing a dataset related to absenteeism and health within a company. The project aims to develop a data-driven approach to determine how to provide bonuses and incentives to healthy employees. Various tools and techniques are employed, including SQL queries, database development, and the creation of a Power BI dashboard.

## Tools Used
#### 1. SQL Queries:

- Create join tables, identify the healthiest employees, and calculate compensation rate increase for non-smokers.
- Optimize queries for efficient data retrieval.

#### 2. Database Development:

- Integrate data from Absenteeism_at_work, compensation, and Reasons tables for a comprehensive dataset.

#### 3. Power BI Dashboard:

- Develop a Power BI dashboard based on wireframe specifications.
- Visualize key metrics and insights derived from SQL queries.
